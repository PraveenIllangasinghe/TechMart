* You can't have any pending deliveries once you signup into the app. Delivery manager need to assign you to some deliveries to update your pending delivery list as well as to work all the relative CRUD operations. So for the demo purpose you can uncomment line 105 - 123 in DeliveryListFragment.java file & just run the application. It will provide you some mock data while running the appplication. 
Also you can see thge real time operation within the firebase console!!
